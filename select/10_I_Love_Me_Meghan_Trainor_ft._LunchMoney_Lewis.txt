Now everybody say, hey
Oh (hey), I love me
Hey-hey-hey (I love me)

They gon' say all kinds of things
They'll make jokes about my name
They gon' try to clip my wings, but I'm gon' fly (I'm gon' fly) (yeah)
They'll try to play me like a game
I bet they're too scared of the fame
But I can see it clearer when I'm lookin' in the mirror
Saying God made me just right

Now everybody say, "Hey"
Oh (hey), I love me
Hey-hey-hey (I love me)

I ain't waitin' on nobody's call (what?)
You don't want me, baby, that's your loss (your loss)
I'll be fine (I'm good) (I'll be fine, baby)
And you can tell by the way I talk (you hear me)
And you can tell by the way I walk (two stepping, baby)
That I can see it clearer when I'm lookin' in the mirror
Saying God made me just right

Oh, I love me (hey), I love me (yeah)
I don't know about you, but baby, I love me (yeah)
Now everybody say, "Hey" (c'mon)
Oh (hey), I love me

I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
I love all y'all, but I love me the most
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
I love all y'all, but I love me the most
Go and raise your glass, give yourself a toast
I love all y'all, but I love me the most
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
I love all y'all, but I love me

I love me (I love me), I love me (yeah)
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But baby, I love me (baby, I love me)
Now everybody say, "Hey" (hey-hey)
